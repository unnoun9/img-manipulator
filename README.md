# An Image Manipulator made in Java for Learning Purposes
- *Incomplete Project*.
- It only has very basic filters and tools.
- I planned to use ImgScalr and OpenCV, which are setup in the project, but haven't yet quite gotten into it.

## Build process
- Assuming java is present on your machine, just run `./build.sh`. On windows, I recommend getting the git bash terminal (or the sh.exe executable) that comes with [git](https://git-scm.com/) to run the script.
